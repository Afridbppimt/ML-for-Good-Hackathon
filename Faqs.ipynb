      "Transcript: Iâ€™m a woman, aged 63 (almost 64) and still working full time because of the change in the pension age. I was hospitalised with Swine flu in 2009 and it had a big effect on my health. I was diagnosed with asthma in 2010. My lungs have never fully recovered from the severe case of Swine flu. \n",
      "I normally work nine to five and thereâ€™s have been times over the past two years when Iâ€™ve felt very tired and weary. But it wasnâ€™t until this pandemic hit that I actually felt old for the first time in my life. Iâ€™ll admit that I went into a blind spin panic when I realised how bad this pandemic was at the end of March. Stress being one of the triggers for my asthma, the feeling of dread and tightness in my chest caused my asthma to peak. I remembered how ill i was in 2009 and the feeling that I just wanted to die and due to my weakened lungs I couldnâ€™t shake the fear. I rang my doctor (not wanting to visit the surgery) and she advised I double up my asthma medication and issued a prescription for extra supplies. My son went to pick it up from the pharmacy the next day, only to discover they couldnâ€™t get supplies of my usual medication. Another call to my doctor and she prescribed an alternative to the medication I had been on since 2010 and my initial asthma diagnosis. A few days later my wheezing had eased but I found I was suffering from severe reflux at nights. So bad it almost choked me on a few occasions, thus adding to my considerable stress. Another call to my doctor, who said the reflux was caused by stress so I was given acid suppressants and signed off work until everything could settle down a bit. I work for a train operating company so I am considered a key worker. \n",
      "In summary, I have found the last six weeks to be the most stressful weeks of my life. Iâ€™ve always considered myself to be as fit and able as my younger colleagues but this crisis has made me realise I need to take better care of myself and not put my job first. This virus has reminded me that I am getting old.\n"
